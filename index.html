    <p>
      I am Luke Pollard, born May 23, 2003. I completed elementary and high
      school here in my hometown in a French Immersion program. <br />
      This Bootcamp is my first introduction to Coding and Web Development. I
      took some computer science courses using only Python, during these courses
      we had many projects creating mainly form pages. <br />
      I am currently working as a Construction laborer which consists of lots of
      manual labor, I primarily work on excavation and grading projects and
      water/sewer system repair and installation. <br />
      My first language is English, I am capable of speaking, reading, and
      writing in French but am always looking to improve. <br />
      Some activities I enjoy are working and driving cars. Currently, my
      brother and I are working on our project vehicles along with some daily
      driver vehicles we repair in hopes of selling. We both bought vehicles
      that required large metalwork therefore we learned welding along with many
      other skills
